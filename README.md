## Synopsis

This project is based of Stephen Grider's Udemy tutorial.
It is an application that tracks employees' and logs a record about them.

This App could be very useful tool for project managers that like to micro-manage every single aspect of an employee's working life. The manager could then decide wether to fire or keep the employee with this helpful App.

All kidding aside, the context of the app is awful. However, It is a very good guide to build a more complex projects with redux.
